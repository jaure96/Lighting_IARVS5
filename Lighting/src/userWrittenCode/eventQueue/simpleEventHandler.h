* The file declares the interface for an event queue with a static size. To
* use the queue, the queue must be initialized by a call to the function
* SEQ_Initialize. Next, call the functions SEQ_AddEvent, SEQ_RetrieveEvent,
* SEQ_Clear and SEQ_EventPendingP as needed in order to add and retrieve 
* events.
